# Movie-Library-Application

This was my solution to a Java (mainly just an intro to OOP) course's project in a CS Bachelor program I am pursuing.

The project's description that was sent to the course's students is available at `Description/Java Project - Phase *`. It was divided into two phases, each phase's description is in a different file, the same applies to the solution, each phase's solution is in a seperate folder. The second (final) phase's solution represents the 'complete' program.
